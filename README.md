# tic-tac-toe
## What is this project?
This project was created by me under the instructions of Dr. Williams at MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding with MERN. The logic behind it is the traditional Tic-Tac-Toe game to be played in the computer. This project uses React, and there is great deal of the state using the React.useState() function. People just feel fun playing it, because it is very interesting trying to gain the game. Also, I enjoyed a lot the procedure of building this project.
## Roadmap of future improvements
So, after making the final project, I asked to make some refactoring to that project. So, I made one change based on a thing that I believe is important for this project. This change is that if a person clicks to a button, then even if this person try to click again and again, the value of that button will never change. This is important because some users might try to play with some tricks like changing their first click on a button. By this way, when a button is clicked, whichever its value is, it will never change.
